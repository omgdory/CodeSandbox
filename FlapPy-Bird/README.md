FlapPy-Bird (READ BELOW)
===========
My first beginner project from October 2022! Wasn't until much later that I published it on GitHub...
A simple clone of Flappy Bird. Created using Python and the official [PyGame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) library.

## THIS IS AN OLD VERSION
I added this here in CodeSandbox so that I may keep it as a way to look back at my old programming habits and to see how much I've developed.
Please do not consider this as a reflection of my skills today.
